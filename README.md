But i want to be a better coder. Let me put code into product.


# stop being a pussy coder
waiting for the company to give your jobs.   
Be a god coder  
make  a lot jobs for others
creatatin

when coder or people compete for jobs\
Feel like a human craving for sex\
boring

# why self mute
when i want to create something \
I feel fear that it going to damage my futere in China\
I need to stop this feeling even it is real.\
There is self censorship in China.\
Which is crazy\
Let me fight this\


# I think i understand the coder way
Only one way to success, write nice code\
imagine you and your coworker working in the same team\
what is the difference of position and salary\
In China is leader decide, In others, more like let the market the decide\
So how to let market decide, the only way is to write good code product.

# I think i did it
I code for fun. 
I master Leetcode to be a good programmer not all for a better job.
